# 💻 Dev or Not?  
### A Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person *is a programmer or not* — just from their text!  
Includes training script, CLI prediction tool, and a Telegram bot. 🤖✨

## 📌 About the Project

This project builds a text classifier that predicts whether the author of a given sentence is a **programmer** or **non-programmer**.  
After training the model, you can interact with it in two ways:

1. **Command-line interface (CLI)** using `predict.py`  
2. **Telegram bot** using `bot.py`  

The goal is to make the project simple, educational, clean, and easily extendable.
